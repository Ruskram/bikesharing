## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help out someone wanting to start a bike sharing service in another city by getting data on a bike sharing service that is used in New York City. We want to analyze this data and create visualizations to for our friend so they can take this presentation and present it to potential investors. We will be using Tableau which is a BI tool that makes it very easy to import a data set and create nice looking charts and graphs for presentations.

This visualization is showing how the story function is used to display all of the visualizations that have been done. This is can be used to create an interactive presentation that can be used to display data and if people have questions can be easily filtered to show the data that is in question. For example, if someone wanted to see all how long females use bikes they can go to the second visulization and filter for females as shown below.
